When asked to perform airdrop initial mapping:
1. Refer to $PROJECT_ROOT/code/src/functions/external-system/external_domain_metadata.json for the external domain metadata.
2. The initial mapping file is at $PROJECT_ROOT/code/src/functions/external-system/initial_domain_mapping.json.
3. Call 'use_mapping' to test out how the initial mapping behaves on the current metadata.
4. Use MCP tools to manipulate the initial mapping when adding and removing record type mappings, or unmapping fields, or mapping simple fields.
5. For more complex field mappings (if map_field reports the method is not yet supported) you may edit the mapping file directly.
6. Refer to the initial_mappings_schema.yaml for its proper format.
7. When referring to initial_mappings_schema.yaml, always use the 'use_mapping' tool to verify the mapping file is still valid.
8. Use the 'get_field_options' tool to discover what field mappings are available for the given DevRev fields.
9. Discuss with the user to clarify the requirements on how they want the external system to be mapped to DevRev!
