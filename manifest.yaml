# The types of connections that the snap-in supports.
# If an external system supports OAuth, then you should use that.

# at https://github.com/devrev/snap-in-examples/tree/main/13-keyring-type.

  # The keyring type ID can be whatever you want, but it has to match one of the allowed

    # Connection details that are showed when creating a connection in the DevRev app.
    # You can freely change them, but the external system name should have the first letter capitalized.
